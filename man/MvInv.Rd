\title{Invert jump heights function}
\usage{
MvInv(eps, u = 0.5, alpha = 1, kappa = 1, gama = 1/2, N = 3001)
}
\arguments{
\item{eps}{Dummy argument kept for consistency with past versions of the functions}

\item{u}{Real number. The value of the latent variable at the current step.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric constant. Total mass of the centering measure.}

\item{kappa}{Numeric positive constant.}

\item{gama}{Numeric constant. Discount parameter of the NRMI process.}

\item{N}{Number of steps in the discretization scheme for the grid inversion.

## The function has been optimised but it is morally defined as MvInv_old.R}
}
\description{
Determines the jump heights of an increasing additive process by inverting
the M(v) function. Use a truncation level based on expected moments of the NGG process (\code{\link{thresholdGG}}).
For internal use.
